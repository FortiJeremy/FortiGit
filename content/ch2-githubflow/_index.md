### ***Learn what software workflows are, and how we use them.***



Software development workflows are a set of processes and practices used to manage the creation, testing, and deployment of software applications. From a networking perspective, you can think of software development workflows as similar to network operations workflows that are used to manage the deployment and maintenance of network infrastructure.

In software development, the workflow typically starts with requirements gathering and analysis, where developers work with stakeholders to define the scope and requirements of the software application. This is similar to network engineers working with business stakeholders to understand their networking requirements.

Next, developers create a design for the application, which includes the software architecture, data models, and user interfaces. This is similar to network engineers creating network diagrams and architectural designs for the network infrastructure.

Once the design is complete, the software development team begins the implementation phase, where they write code and develop software components. This is similar to network engineers configuring network devices and implementing network services.

During the implementation phase, developers also perform testing and quality assurance to ensure that the software works as intended and meets the requirements. This is similar to network engineers performing network testing and monitoring to ensure that the network infrastructure is performing optimally and meeting business requirements.

Once the testing is complete, the software is deployed to a production environment. This is similar to network engineers deploying network infrastructure and services to production environments.

After deployment, developers continue to monitor and maintain the software, making bug fixes and adding new features as needed. This is similar to network engineers performing ongoing network maintenance and troubleshooting to ensure that the network infrastructure is operating smoothly.

Overall, software development workflows are an essential part of creating and maintaining software applications. They help developers and stakeholders manage the complex processes involved in software development and ensure that software applications meet business requirements and deliver value to users.
