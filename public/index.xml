      <description>GitHub flow&amp;hellip; is a way of managing software development workflows using Git and GitHub. It is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that emphasizes collaboration, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.
From a networking perspective, think of each branch in the workflow as a separate network segment or VLAN. Each branch represents a different development environment where code changes can be tested and integrated before being merged into the main codebase.
The workflow starts with a developer creating a new branch for a feature or bug fix.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1 - What is Git Git Summary Git is a distributed version control system designed to help developers manage and collaborate on software projects. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. Git is open source software and is free to use, making it accessible to developers of all levels.
The core idea behind Git is to provide a way for developers to track changes made to a codebase over time, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other.</description>

So all you have to do is copy your hugo content into your parent repo root directory copy your entire Hugo folder DemoFrontEnd to the root of the repo you&amp;rsquo;re using for your Demo. Folder structure should look similar to the following: </description>

      <description>Git Branches Git branches are a key feature of Git that allow developers to create independent lines of development for a project. A branch is essentially a separate version of the codebase that exists alongside the main codebase in the repository. This allows developers to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase until they are ready to be merged.
The basic process of branching in Git involves creating a new branch from an existing branch, which can be the main branch or another existing branch.</description>
